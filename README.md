<p>  • This is one of the best portfolios you would ever come across for a Junior developer, or for someone who has 1> years of experience. </p>

<p>  • I am absolutely in love with the styling on this portfolio for which I have used classic CSS and SCSS. </p>

<p>  • The data and the backend for this portfolio's components is based in Sanity io, which makes it easy for non-coders to edit this site. </p>

<p>  • This portfolio contains the link to all my GitHub respositories and the live view of my projects. </p>

<p>  • This project is completely screen responsive, with the navbar disappering and sidebar appearing in mobile phones. </p>
